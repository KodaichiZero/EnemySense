This mod enables use of a sonar ping ability. If you press Walk while crouching, you will consume a chunk of stamina and send out a wave which senses nearby animals and monsters. Much like how you can reveal an enemy's HP bar in vanilla Valheim by moving your crosshair over it, this mod will do the same within a base radius of 30 meters from your position. However, this mod also scales up this distance to up to 60 meters at Sneak 100, for both the ping AND via crosshair.
